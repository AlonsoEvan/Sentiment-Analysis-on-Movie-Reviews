# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
Kaggle Project

The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis. 
This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset.
We are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive.
Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.

Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice.
